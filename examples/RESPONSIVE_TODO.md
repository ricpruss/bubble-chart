## Responsive Features Being Added

### Core Responsive Capabilities
1. **Automatic Container Sizing**: Charts adapt to container dimensions
2. **Viewport Constraints**: Min/max width and height based on screen size
3. **Mobile Optimizations**: Smaller dimensions and adjusted layouts for mobile
4. **Debounced Resize Handling**: Smooth resize performance
5. **Aspect Ratio Maintenance**: Optional aspect ratio preservation

### Visual Improvements
1. **Responsive Typography**: Using `clamp()` for font sizes
2. **Flexible Layouts**: Using CSS flexbox and grid where appropriate
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices

## Standard Responsive Configuration Template

### For Full Responsiveness (Recommended)
```javascript
.withResponsive({
  minWidth: 320,
  minHeight: 350,
  maxHeight: 600,
  debounceMs: 200,
  onResize: (dimensions) => {
    console.log('📏 Chart resized to:', dimensions);
  }
})
```

### For Constrained Layouts (Use Sparingly)
```javascript
.withResponsive({
  minWidth: 320,
  maxWidth: 800,  // Only when container width needs limiting
  minHeight: 350,
  maxHeight: 600,
  aspectRatio: 1.2,  // Only when specific ratio needed
  maintainAspectRatio: true,
  debounceMs: 200
})
```
